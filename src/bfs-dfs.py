# Sure! Let's dive into how you can implement Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms in Python.
#
# ### Depth First Search (DFS) Implementation
#
# DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack to remember the next vertex to visit.
#
# Here’s a simple implementation of DFS for a graph represented using an adjacency list:
#
# ```python
def dfs(graph, start):
	visited = set()
	stack = [start]

	while stack:
		vertex = stack.pop()
		if vertex not in visited:
			visited.add(vertex)
			# Process vertex
			print(vertex)
			# Push adjacent vertices onto stack
			stack.extend(graph[vertex] - visited)  # subtracting visited nodes

	return visited

# Example usage:
graph = {
	'A': {'B', 'C'},
	'B': {'A', 'D', 'E'},
	'C': {'A', 'F'},
	'D': {'B'},
	'E': {'B', 'F'},
	'F': {'C', 'E'}
}

print("DFS traversal:")
dfs(graph, 'A')
# ```
#
# In this example:
# - `graph` is represented as an adjacency list.
# - `dfs` function starts from the `start` node and explores each node using a stack.
# - It prints each node as it visits and continues until all reachable nodes are visited.
#
# ### Breadth First Search (BFS) Implementation
#
# BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to manage the order of exploration.
#
# Here’s a straightforward implementation of BFS using a queue for a graph represented similarly as an adjacency list:
#
# ```python
#
#
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
	visited = set()
	queue = deque([start])

	while queue:
		vertex = queue.popleft()
		if vertex not in visited:
			visited.add(vertex)
			# Process vertex
			print(vertex)
			# Enqueue adjacent vertices
			queue.extend(graph[vertex] - visited)  # subtracting visited nodes

	return visited

# Example usage (same graph as before):
print("\nBFS traversal:")
bfs(graph, 'A')
# ```
#
# In this example:
# - `bfs` function performs BFS starting from the `start` node.
# - It uses a `deque` from Python's `collections` module for efficient popping from the left (front) and extending from the right (back).
# - Similar to DFS, it prints each node as it visits and continues until all reachable nodes are visited.
#
# ### Key Points to Note:
#
# - **Adjacency List Representation**: Both DFS and BFS implementations assume the graph is represented using an adjacency list.
# - **Visited Set**: Both algorithms use a `visited` set to keep track of nodes that have been visited to avoid processing nodes multiple times.
# - **Data Structures**: DFS uses a stack (implemented using Python's list), while BFS uses a queue (implemented using `deque` for efficient operations).
#
# ### Conclusion:
#
# These implementations provide a foundational understanding of how to code DFS and BFS algorithms in Python. They can be adapted and extended for various graph-related problems and applications, including pathfinding, cycle detection, and more complex graph traversals. Adjustments may be needed based on specific requirements and characteristics of the graph being processed.
